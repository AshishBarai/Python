Question:-

Now, let's use our knowledge of sets and help Mickey.

Ms. Gabriel Williams is a botany professor at District College. One day, 
she asked her student Mickey to compute the average of all the plants with 
distinct heights in her greenhouse.

Code:-

def avg(array):
    array = set(array)
    avg = sum(array)/len(array)
    return avg
if __name__ = '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int,input().split()))
    result = average(arr)
    print(result)
