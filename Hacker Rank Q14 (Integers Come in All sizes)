'Python 3'

Question:-

Integers in Python can be as big as the bytes in your machine's memory. There is no limit in size 
as there is: 2^31 - 1 (c++ int) or 2^36 - 1 (C++ long long int).

As we know, the result of a^b grows really fast with increasing b.

Let's do some calculations on very large integers.

Task
Read four numbers, a,b,c and d, and print the result of a^b + c^d.


solution:-

a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
d = int(input())

print((a**b) + (c**d))
