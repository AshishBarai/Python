"Python"

QUESTION:-

The included code stub will read an integer, n, from STDIN.

Without using any string methods, try to print the following:
123...n

Note that "..." represents the consecutive values in between.

CODE:-

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
number = list(range(1+n))
for i in number:
    if i > 0 and i <=150:
        print(i, end = '')
